# `ln`

`ln` is a personal collection of unique software and third-party libraries made
to work nicely together for FreeRTOS embedded systems development.

## TODO

- Consider switching to
  [jonenz/FreeRTOS-Cpp](https://github.com/jonenz/FreeRTOS-Cpp) instead of
  [freertos-addons](https://github.com/michaelbecker/freertos-addons). It is
  newer and more actively maintained, comes with CMake support, more modern C++,
  more familiar and arguably better project structure, testing and CI.
